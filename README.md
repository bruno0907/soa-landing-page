## Project

<p>The purpose of this project was to allow players of World of Warcraft at the Azralon-US server to apply for sposts on the raiding team of the guild. 
With this tool we was able to allow any player of the guild to advertise our spots in-game and redirecting the interested players to our plataform where it had all the information it needed to procced with its apply. Once its apply was submitted a integration with our discord nofifies us of the new apply allowing promptly response to the applicant.</p>

<p>The project ran for more than one year and we had over 200 applicants looking for a spot. At the end of the guild due to end of pandemic and return of presencial jobs and classes the project was kept online for demonstration purpose only.</p>

<p>*Obs.:If you want to try the apply flow you need a valid Azralon-US World of Warcraft account with valid raider.io.</p>
